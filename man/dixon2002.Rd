  A measure of segregation describes the tendency of one species to be  associated with itself or with other species. Dixon (2002) proposed a measure of the 
  \strong{segregation of species} \emph{i} in a multiespecies  spatial pattern as:
  
  \deqn{S[i] = log{[(N[ii]/(N[i]-N[ii])] / [(N[i]-1)/(N-N[i])]}}
  
  where \eqn{N[i]} is the number of \emph{i} individuals, \eqn{N[ii]} is the frequency of species \emph{i} as neighbor of especies \emph{i} and \eqn{N} is the total
  number of locations.   Values of \eqn{S[i]} larger than 0 indicate that species \emph{i} is segregated; the larger the value of \eqn{S[i]}, the more extreme the segregation. 
  Values of \eqn{S[i]} less than 0 indicate that species \emph{i} is is found as neighbor of itself less than expected under random labelling. 
  Values of \eqn{S[i]} close to 0 are consistent with random labelling of the neighbors of species \emph{i}.
  
  Dixon (2002) proposed also a \strong{pairwise segregation index} for the off-diagonal elements of the contingency table:
  
  \deqn{S[ij] = log{[(N[ij]/(N[i]-N[ij])] / [(N[i])/(N-N[j])-1]}}
  
  \eqn{S[ij]} is larger than 0 when \eqn{N[ij]}, the frequency of neighbors of species \emph{j} around points of species \emph{i}, is larger than expected under random
  labelling and less than 0 when \eqn{N[ij]} is smaller than expected under random labelling.
    
  As a \strong{species/neighbor-specific test}, Dixon(2002) proposed the statistic
  \deqn{Z[ij] =(N[ij] -EN[ij])/sqrt(Var N[ij])}
  where \emph{j} may be the same as \emph{i} and \eqn{EN[ij]} is the expected count in the contingency table. It has an asymptotic normal distribution with mean 0 
  and variance 1;  its asymptotic p-valure  can be obtained from the numerical evaluation of the cumulative normal distribution  or by simulation, i.e, by condicting
  a randomization test (appropriate when the sample size is small). 
     
  An \strong{overall test of random labelling} (i.e. a test that all counts in the \eqn{k x k} nearest-neighbor contingency table are equal to their expected counts) is based
  on the quadratic form
  \deqn{ C = (N-EN)' Sigma^-1 (N - EN)}
where \eqn{N} is the vector of all cell counts in the contingency table, \eqn{Sigma} is the variance-covariance matrix of those counts and \eqn{Sigma^-1}
is a generalized inverse of \eqn{Sigma}. Under the null hypothesis of random labelling of points, \eqn{C}  has a asymptotic Chi-square distribution with \eqn{k(k-1)} 
degrees of freedom (if the sample sizes are small its distribution should be estimated using Monte-Carlo simulation). P-values are computed from the probability of observing
equal or larger values of \eqn{C}.
The overall statistic \eqn{C} can be partitioned into \eqn{k} \strong{species-specific test} statistics \eqn{C[i]}. Each \eqn{C[i]} test if the frequencies of the neighbors 
of species \emph{i} are similar to the expected frequencies if the points were randomly labelled. Because the \eqn{C[i]} are not independent Chi-square statistics, they do not
sum to the overall \eqn{C}.

}

 \section{Warning}{
The \eqn{S[i]} and \eqn{S[ij]} statistics asume that the spatial nearest-neighbor process is stationary, at least to second order, 
  i.e., have the same sign in every part of the entire plot. A biologically heterogeneous process violates this asumption.
